# Soil Moisture Sensor Project

A simple system to monitor soil moisture levels using an Arduino and a soil moisture sensor.

## 🌱 Features
- Monitor soil moisture in real-time.
- Send alerts when soil moisture is too low.
- Data logging for moisture levels over time.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Connect the soil moisture sensor to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code to your board.
3. Open the serial monitor to see the moisture readings.

## 🔧 Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Arduino Board (e.g., Uno)
